# ThreeWP Broadcast Finnish translation

Translating ThreeWP Broadcast -plugin and plugin packs consists of two translation files

## Main plugin translation ( this is work in progress )

* ThreeWP_Broadcast-fi.mo (use 'fi_FI' if your WordPress installation language is that instead of 'fi')
* ThreeWP_Broadcast-fi.po (use 'fi_FI' if your WordPress installation language is that instead of 'fi')
* Insert these files here: threewp-broadcast/lang/


## Premium pack translation ( this is very much work in progress )

* Broadcast_Pack-fi.mo (use 'fi_FI' if your WordPress installation language is that instead of 'fi')
* Broadcast_Pack-fi.po (use 'fi_FI' if your WordPress installation language is that instead of 'fi')
* Insert these files here: threewp-broadcast/src/premium_pack/lang
